        "On exam 1, I proposed the problem of having 10 cases of water with 10 bottles in each case and 10 oz in each bottle.  One case is known to be filled with one ounce less than all the other bottles.  Jacob proposed a random selection method for finding the case with the bottles that have less water.  Essentially he'll pull one bottle and test it.  If it is 9 ounces, he has found the case that is short.  Let's explore this random test.\n",
